Iteration Report 1
------------------
Cass and Doug were responsible for completing a basic skeleton of the front end and the index and layout pages. As well as View tasklist frontend, add/delete tasks frontend, Water plants frontend.
Ian and Julia were responsible for getting app.py set up for the backend and the basic schema for the database set up. Also a backend for the view task list feature.
For what was completed
-----------------------
* The app.py and database are set up with minimal features like delete, add, and complete task.
* The front end basic skeleton was set up 

Planned but not finished
------------------------
* We planned to make a view task list function that we did not get to
* Also the water plants front end and front end add/delete tasks did not get finished

Troubles/issues
---------------
* We ran into a couple small errors with the database setup and changing how we would like the database to be structured.
* We ran into some db connection errors when setting up the db on our own computers.

Adjustments to Design
---------------------
* We made adjustments to the structure of the db to make it logically make more sense to prevent confusion

Tool or Process

* One process that worked well for us was working in pairs to be able to exchange ideas with each other while working on the same portion of the project.
