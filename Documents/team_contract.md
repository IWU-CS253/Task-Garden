A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their own "rules of engagement" through the development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be developed and signed **BEFORE** starting the actual course project. For the Team Contract to be valid, provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course schedule. Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records. This document is more for your group than it is for me, so feel free to tailor it to your group's needs.

## Project Team Name:
### Task Garden

### A. Team Structure:

1. **Leadership structure**:
	Doug -> Ian -> Cass -> Julia
2. **Decision-making policy** (by consensus? by majority vote? how will tie votes be handled?):
	Decisions will be solved by majority vote. Any ties will be broken by the leader that week.
3. **Who is the team Recorder/Documentation Manager/Maintainer of all required turn-ins?**
	The leader that week will be in charge of documantation and managment of all turn-ins.
4. **Day, time, and place for regular team meetings:**
	We will meet during our class time on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM. We will meet after our class time at 4:00 PM as needed on Monday and Friday. We will meet in E204 during our classtime and may choose to move to Dugout after class. We will also meet on Sunday at 7:00 PM in Dugout.
5. **Usual method of communication** (e.g., email, cell phone, chat, in person):
	Text group chat set up in class


### B. Team Procedures:

1. **Method for setting and following meeting agendas** (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting?):
	At the begining of each week, we'll collaberative set an agenda for that week with the group leader having the final say. We will be notified in class for after class meeting and the group leader will be responsable for sending a reminder in the group chat for meetings outside of our class time. The team leader will ve responsible for ensuring the team is following the agenda.
2. **Method of record keeping** (Who will be responsible for recording and disseminating minutes? How and when will the minutes be disseminated? Where will all agendas and minutes be stored?):
	The group leader will be responsable for recording and disseminating minutes. The minutes and agendas will be stored in a markdown file in the GitHub repository.
3. **Procedures in the absence of a team member** (will the team meet with one member absent, or must all members be present?):
	If a team member must be absent, we will try to host them over Zoom. If they cannot make it over Zoom, the team leader will be responsable for informing the absent member of their responsabilities are and they must fulfull their responabilities remotly.

### C. Team Participation:

1. **Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:**
	All group members get an input on their tasks that week, and the team leader has the final say.
2. **Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members** (team maintenance):
	Team members will talk with each other and we will assign issues through GitHub
3. **Strategies for keeping on task** (task maintenance):
	The team leader will direct conversation to being on task and that everyone is working on what they need to be.

### D. Personal Accountability:

1. **Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:**
	Team members will be expected to be at every meeting. If a team member has to be absent, they are expected to alert the team through the group chat ahead of time. Exesive absences will not be allowed.
2. **Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:**
	Teammates will be expected to submit their work by team made deadlines. 24 hour extentions may be granted as requested.
3. **Expected level of communication with other team members:**
	Communicate when making a pull request, ask team members if you need help, attend and participate in all meetings.
4. **Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.**
	Tasks will be distributed equally and everyone will be involved in team decisions.

### E. Consequences of breach of contract:

What procedures and penalties do you wish to implement in the case of "slackers" or team members who deviate from your Team Contract? You basically have two options here: 1.) No Peer Evaluation or 2.) Peer Evaluation. Either option is acceptable to me, but I strongly advise you implement Peer Evaluation so that you have a mechanism in place if problems arise.

1. **Peer Evaluation**: 
	One grace token will be allowed per team member and it can be used as seen fit. After there grace token has been used, points wil be docked from the member's score. Meeting missed: 20%; Team late work: 20%; Class late work: 40%. Don't be evil.

### F. Changes to contract:
You cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures" section, once the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY SPECIFIC on the Procedures section and spend some time thinking about this section. The only way I will accept a change to your Team Contract is if ALL members of your team sign and date a written amendment to your initial agreement.
